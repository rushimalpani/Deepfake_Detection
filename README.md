Unified Deep Fake Media Detection
Cross-Modal Analysis of Audio, Text, Image, and Video
In an age where digital editing tools have become more accessible and advanced, the proliferation of deepfake content poses a significant threat to the integrity of digital media.
This Unified Deep Fake Media Detection project is dedicated to addressing this challenge through innovative cross-modal analysis techniques.

By integrating methodologies from Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, this project aims to detect deepfakes across multiple media formats, including:

Audio: Identifying synthetic or manipulated speech patterns.
Text: Recognizing inconsistencies in AI-generated or altered textual content.
Image: Detecting visual distortions or artifacts left by generative models.
Video: Analyzing temporal inconsistencies and manipulation traces in motion sequences.
Through a unified approach, this solution seeks to identify manipulation patterns across modalities, offering robust tools to counter digital deception and preserve the authenticity of online content.
